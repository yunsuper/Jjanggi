# Prototype Explanation

## PlayScene.js Updates (2025년 11월 17일)

### Deselection Logic Implementation

**Description:**
Implemented enhanced deselection logic within `frontend/src/PlayScene.js` to improve user experience when interacting with game pieces.

**Changes Made:**

1.  **Clicking an already selected piece:**
    *   Modified the `clickPiece` function to check if the `clickedPieceId` is the same as `this.selectedPieceId`.
    *   If they are the same, the piece is deselected (`this.selectedPieceId = null;`), and its scale is reset to 1. This allows players to easily deselect a piece by clicking it again.

2.  **Clicking an empty board space:**
    *   Added logic to the `board.on('pointerdown')` event listener.
    *   If `this.selectedPieceId` is not null (meaning a piece is currently selected) and an empty part of the board is clicked, the selected piece is deselected (`this.selectedPieceId = null;`), its scale is reset to 1, and the `movablePositions` array is cleared. This provides an intuitive way to clear selection without making a move.

3.  **Clicking an enemy piece or out-of-turn piece:**
    *   Ensured that if a player clicks on an opponent's piece or a piece that is not their turn, the currently selected piece (if any) is deselected.

These changes address the `TODO` comment regarding deselection and provide a more robust and user-friendly selection mechanism.

### Async/Await and Error Handling Correction in `clickPiece`

**Description:**
Corrected a logical error in the `clickPiece` function's `fetch` call handling to ensure proper `async/await` usage and error management.

**Changes Made:**

1.  **Assigned `fetch` result:** The result of the `await fetch(...)` call is now correctly assigned to a `response` variable.
2.  **Proper `response.ok` check:** The `if (!response.ok)` condition now correctly checks the `ok` property of the `response` object.
3.  **Improved error throwing:** When `response.ok` is false, a more informative error is thrown, including the HTTP status.
4.  **Correct `response.json()` usage:** The `await response.json()` call now correctly uses the `response` variable.

This ensures that the asynchronous API call for movable positions is handled robustly, with appropriate error detection and reporting.

### Async/Await and Error Handling Correction in `initializeBoard`

**Description:**
Corrected a logical error in the `initializeBoard` function's `fetch` call handling to ensure proper `async/await` usage and error management.

**Changes Made:**

1.  **Assigned `fetch` result:** The result of the `await fetch(...)` call is now correctly assigned to a `response` variable.
2.  **Proper `response.ok` check:** The `if (!response.ok)` condition now correctly checks the `ok` property of the `response` object.
3.  **Improved error throwing:** When `response.ok` is false, a more informative error is thrown, including the HTTP status.
4.  **Correct `response.json()` usage:** The `await response.json()` call now correctly uses the `response` variable.

This ensures that the asynchronous API call for initializing the board is handled robustly, with appropriate error detection and reporting.

### `displayMovablePositions` Function Corrections and Integration

**Description:**
Corrected several issues in the `displayMovablePositions` function and integrated its calls into the piece selection and deselection logic.

**Changes Made:**

1.  **Constructor Update:** Added `this.movableMarkers = null;` to the constructor to manage the graphics object for movable position markers.
2.  **Typo Corrections:** Fixed `destory` to `destroy` and `tadius` to `radius`.
3.  **Correct Iteration:** Changed the loop from `this.movableMarkers.forEach` to `this.movablePositions.forEach` to correctly iterate over the array of movable positions.
4.  **Parameter Removal:** Removed the `movablePositions` parameter from the `displayMovablePositions` function definition, as it now consistently uses the class property `this.movablePositions`.
5.  **Integration in `clickPiece`:**
    *   After successfully fetching and updating `this.movablePositions`, `this.displayMovablePositions()` is called to show the markers.
    *   In the `catch` block (on error), `this.movablePositions` is cleared, and `this.displayMovablePositions()` is called to ensure any existing markers are removed.
6.  **Integration in Board Click Handler:**
    *   When an empty space on the board is clicked, `this.movablePositions` is cleared, and `this.displayMovablePositions()` is called to remove any displayed markers.

These changes ensure that movable positions are correctly displayed and cleared, enhancing the visual feedback for the player.

### Bug Fix: Movable Position Markers Not Appearing

**Description:**
Fixed two critical bugs that prevented the movable position markers from being displayed and caused an error when clicking the board after selecting a piece.

**Changes Made:**

1.  **`displayMovablePositions` Function:**
    *   Corrected a runtime error by changing the loop to iterate over the `this.movablePositions` array instead of the `this.movableMarkers` graphics object.
    *   Fixed a typo from `destory` to `destroy`.

2.  **`clickPiece` Function:**
    *   Added the missing `this.displayMovablePositions()` call after successfully fetching movable positions from the server. This ensures the markers are drawn as intended.

These fixes resolve the reported issues, making the movable position markers functional and stable.
